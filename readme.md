The project is a treasure hunting web/mobile app that allows the admin to 
set up different treasures at different sites. The app uses GPS to 
determine when a user is within the radius of a treasure, and then 
presents a riddle or clue that the user must solve to find the treasure in 
that area. The treasure locations are strategically placed in hotspots or 
places that encourage bonding and exploration.

The app shows in real-time where the current users are, the locations of 
the treasures, and the rewards for each treasure. Additionally, the app 
includes a scoreboard that displays the top users who have found the most 
treasures. The rewards for each treasure can vary and can include 
vouchers, discounts, or free services from different establishments.

This project is not only a great way to bond with friends and family, but 
it can also boost tourism in the area where the treasures are located. By 
encouraging people to explore and discover new places, the project can 
promote local businesses and attractions, and create a fun and engaging 
experience for everyone involved.
